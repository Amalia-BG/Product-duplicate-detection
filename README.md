# Product-duplicate-detection
Scalability in duplicate detection problem based on LSH (data set of TVs).
It is mostly based on the methodology of Hartveld, A., van Keulen, M., Mathol, D., van Noort, T., Plaatsman, T., Frasincar, F., Schouten, K.: An lsh-based model-words-driven product duplicate detection method. In: International Conference on Advanced Information Systems Engineering. pp. 409â€“423. Springer (2018).
But also includes some adaptations, which are marked with "Novel" description in the code.

This README is meant to guide you through the code
